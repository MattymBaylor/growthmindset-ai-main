- **Benefit-first hero messaging and limiting CTAs:** Research shows that the hero section should lead with benefits rather than features and include only one or two CTAs. Multiple CTAs can reduce conversion rates. For example, Prismic notes that the hero should highlight the value proposition and answer “what’s in it for me”【55264054501226†L97-L104】; they also recommend limiting CTAs because research shows that having multiple CTAs can decrease conversions by up to 266%【55264054501226†L122-L129】. This finding is echoed by WiserNotify【540202579478447†L350-L361】 and Sender【165583568969990†L282-L309】, which report that reducing to a single CTA can boost conversions by 266%.
- **Page speed impact on conversion:** Studies compiled by Cloudflare and Huckabuy show that each additional second of load time between 0–5 s can reduce conversion rates by roughly 4.42 %【480641247330675†L16-L29】; pages that load in 2.4 s convert at ~1.9 %, while 5.7 s load times convert at only 0.6 %【480641247330675†L16-L29】. Walmart found that for every 1 s improvement, conversions increased by 2 %【357330049308462†L415-L437】.
- **Form length vs conversion:** Analyses of thousands of landing pages show that conversion rates decrease as the number of form fields increases【676229353409274†L73-L83】. Short forms (3–5 fields) lead to the highest conversions.
- **Meta description and title tag guidelines:** Yoast recommends keeping meta descriptions around 155 characters and using active, benefit-driven language【304913143074854†L104-L131】. Search Engine Land reports that Google displays titles of about 42–46 characters and may rewrite longer titles【282856316653606†L214-L329】.
- **Structured data:** Google’s Organization schema documentation states that there are no required fields but recommends including properties such as `url`, `logo`, `name`, `description`, and contact details【934714449318111†L416-L466】. For SoftwareApplication, required properties include `name` and either `offers.price` along with `aggregateRating` or `review`【40089006228605†L572-L616】.
- **Accessibility standards:** WCAG 2.2 requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text (3:1 for large text) to meet level AA【782719990155378†L795-L817】. Allyant notes that WCAG 2.2 introduces additional criteria for cognitive accessibility and encourages aiming for AA conformance【19626487095841†L131-L139】.
