## üîç Verify DNS Configuration

### Check DNS Propagation
Use these tools to verify your DNS is working:
- https://dnschecker.org/#A/growthmindset.ai
- https://whatsmydns.net/#A/growthmindset.ai

### Expected Results
- A record for growthmindset.ai ‚Üí 76.76.21.21 (Vercel)
- CNAME for www.growthmindset.ai ‚Üí cname.vercel-dns.com

### Test Your Site
After DNS propagates (5-48 hours):
1. Visit: https://growthmindset.ai
2. Visit: https://www.growthmindset.ai
3. Both should load your site with SSL

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Site Not Found" Error
- **Wait**: DNS can take up to 48 hours
- **Clear Cache**: Try incognito/private browsing
- **Check Records**: Verify records in GoDaddy match exactly

### SSL Certificate Issues
- Vercel/Netlify auto-provisions SSL after DNS is verified
- May take 10-30 minutes after DNS propagation
- If stuck, redeploy your site

### WWW vs Non-WWW
- Vercel/Netlify will handle redirects automatically
- Choose primary domain in deployment settings

### GoDaddy Parking Page Still Shows
1. Remove any GoDaddy forwarding/parking
2. Ensure no CNAME records point to park.godaddy.com
3. Clear browser cache

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Screenshot Current Settings**: Before making changes, screenshot your current DNS records

2. **Gradual Migration**: Keep TTL low (600 seconds) during migration for faster updates

3. **Domain Forwarding**: Disable any GoDaddy domain forwarding - it conflicts with DNS records

4. **Development Access**: Add a dev subdomain pointing to your staging environment

5. **Backup DNS**: Export your DNS records after setup for backup
